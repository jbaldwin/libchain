## Readme updates
To edit this file the template is located at `.githooks/readme-template.md`, editing it directly in the root README.md will be overwritten by the `git pre-commit` hook which automatically replaces the code portions of this file with the appropriate examples.

## Code formatting
This library has a `git pre-commit` hook which is installed when `cmake` is invoked.  Any files that are commited will automatically have `clang-format` run on them before.
